<h3>ARRIVAL | MAY 22, 2019</h3>                                   
            
<p>After a flight hour of nearly two hours from <b>Bhubaneswar</b>, the pilot announced of a clear weather & got ready for the most challenging part, i.e landing. My time on the land of capital city of India began the very moment when the Indigo Flight 6E 2489 landed at the <b> Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi</b> in the early morning.</p> 

<br>
<p>
The very moment when the wheels touched the ground, I had a sigh of relief! Having the privilege to fly for the first time wasn’t less than a life changing experience! Above all, the architectural beauty of Delhi airport deserves a standing ovation! Without any more delays, I rushed to the conveyor belt & grabbed my trolley bag and moved towards the exit gate to lead myself <b> towards Gurgaon!</b> </p>

<h3>Towards My Destination: GURGAON! </h3>   
             
<p>I opted the yellow line route of <b>Delhi Metro</b> towards my destination in Gurgaon to get a flavour of this highly acclaimed public transport system. This year the metro service is celebrating its <b>Silver Jubilee</b> (1995-2019) & I felt honoured to have arrived in a time like that. </p>
<br>
<p>
It was a bit challenging to travel for nearly an hour in a standing position with the laptop bag on my back and trolley bag near my feet as I had boarded the train on the peak morning hour, when millions of Delhites take metro to reach their work stations. I was surprised to find people <b>solving MCQs</b> and going vividly through the newspapers in this busiest route of metro as a part of their preparation for <b>UPSC exam</b>, while I was struggling to grab a seat!

<p>
After an hour I deboarded at <b>Huda City Centre</b>, the final station on yellow line. I had reached at Gurgaon, my temporary address for the next two months! Just in last 4.5 hours, I had travelled approximately <b>1900 KM</b>, I hardly could believe that! After some light snacks, an auto dropped me at my hotel, where I was supposed to stay for two nights before shifting to a PG nearby.  
</p>
<br>  
<h3>Twist In The Plot</h3>        
            
<p>
I was a bit alone deep inside and sceptical enough even to go on a strolling to nearby places. I was badly missing my home, my family and my friends! Before coming here, I had an initial talk with a nearby PG to accommodate for the two months. </p>
<br>
<p>But, the unexpected moment came, when the PG supervisor denied access to me mentioning no availability of room. I was literally at a state of shock to have the challenge of finding another PG at an affordable cost within the next two days, or I might get homeless in this city!<b> <i>I had never imagined, survival could even be an issue ever in my life!</b></i> I definitely can’t afford check-in to a hotel for entire two months! </p>
                       

<br>                            
<p>At the end of two days, I booked another nearby hotel for just one night to find a PG somewhere in the city just to make sure I possess a stable physical address during my stay. Somehow, I managed to find a room at an affordable price, which was neither covering the food nor the electricity. On the early morning of 25th May finally I shifted to my room with the luggage and prepared to step inside my office as an intern in that same day. </p>


<br>
<p>Here’s the priceless lesson I’ve captured from this really uncomfortable experience of life:
